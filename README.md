# BrazChat

BrazChat is a simple server-based command line text chat program created with GRPC and C#. It is functional on both LAN and over internet.

## Disclaimer
This client is by no means secure. Security features and encryption have yet to be added, and this is a hobby project just made for fun.
## Installation

Download the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/Brazmann/BrazChat/releases/latest).

## Server Setup

If hosting a server, ensure that you alter the config.json file to use your desired IP and port. By default the server will be hosted on localhost with port 50051.
